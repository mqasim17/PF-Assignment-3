a) Header files

Header files contain ready-made functions and declarations that we include in our program, like <iostream>.

b) Source code

Source code is the actual code written by the programmer in a text file before it is compiled.

c) Comments

Comments are notes written inside the code to explain what it does. They are ignored by the compiler.
